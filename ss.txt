Right now you tried to **execute** the file `go.mod` as if it were a program:

```bash
/home/nazmulhasan77/Hyperledger-Fabric/chaincode/go.mod
```

But `go.mod` is just a **text file**, not an executable, so Bash says:

```
Permission denied
```

---

### âœ… What you should do instead

You need to **open and edit** that file, not run it.

1. Open the file in a text editor (use any one of these commands):

```bash
nano /home/nazmulhasan77/Hyperledger-Fabric/chaincode/go.mod
```

or

```bash
vi /home/nazmulhasan77/Hyperledger-Fabric/chaincode/go.mod
```

or if youâ€™re in VS Code on WSL:

```bash
code /home/nazmulhasan77/Hyperledger-Fabric/chaincode/go.mod
```

---

2. Find the line that looks like:

```go
go 1.22.2
```

Change it to:

```go
go 1.22
```

(or `go 1.23` if you installed Go 1.23 on your system).

---

3. Save the file and run:

```bash
cd /home/nazmulhasan77/Hyperledger-Fabric/chaincode
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```

---

ðŸ‘‰ After that, retry deploying your chaincode:

```bash
cd ~/Hyperledger-Fabric/fabric-samples/test-network
./network.sh deployCC -ccn asset -ccp ../../chaincode -ccl go
```

---

Do you want me to give you the **exact content of a correct `go.mod` file for Fabric chaincode** so you can just copy-paste it and avoid version issues?
